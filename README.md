This boilerplate was forked from [@notrab](https://github.com/notrab)'s repo [create-react-app-redux](https://github.com/notrab/create-react-app-redux). For a more detailed understanding please read his tutorial [posted on Medium](https://medium.com/@notrab/getting-started-with-create-react-app-redux-react-router-redux-thunk-d6a19259f71f). It helped me a lot.
The basics are built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) so you will want to read the User Guide for more goodies.
